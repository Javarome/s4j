          We're looking for someone to create a MacOSX package for version 0.7.1. We would be very grateful if you can find some time to help us out. <a href="feedbacks.html">Contact us</a>, and we'll make the package available to all Mac users. </li>
        <li><span class="newsdate">[19-sept-2005]</span><br />
          A glitch in the Windows installer is fixed. Please download again if Stellarium 0.7.1 didn't work for you. </li>

          Release 0.7.1 irons out some bugs that surfaced when 0.7.0 went public. Your location coordinates will now be saved from within the program, among other bugfixes. And with this version 0.7, some interesting Stellarium scripts are appearing. Have a look in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=278769">forum</a> to see what people are doing, or share your own scripts. </li>
        <li><span class="newsdate">[8-sept-2005]</span><br />
          A new version has been released! Version 0.7.0 is the result of almost a year of development. Check out the <a href="changelog.txt">changelog</a> to see what's new, and tell us what you think. Updates to the FAQ will follow shortly. Thanks to the team for the many improvements in this version. Stellarium is now scriptable, new languages have been added, mouse dragging is available... explore, and enjoy! </li>
        <li><span class="newsdate">[2-sept-2005]</span><br />
          Stellarium has attracted a new developer: Tony is working to implement some ideas in the user interface. Some of his work will already be in version 0.7.0 of Stellarium, which is now only days away from release (if everything goes according to plan). Your encouragement is, as always, appreciated! </li>
        <li><span class="newsdate">[24-jun-2005]</span><br />
          Contribute to Stellarium, STOP Software Patents! The Software Patents Directive, as approved by the European Council of Ministers, would codify US-style Software Patents in the European Union. If that happens, software developers will no longer own what they write and can be sued for selling or distributing their own software. This would not only endanger your job, but the entire European software sector. Patents on pure logic would even restrict the freedom of publication. On the 6th of July, the European Parliament will have the last chance to prevent this. To do so, 367 of the 732 members must be present and vote for the right amendments. Please visit this site and act : <a href="http://noepatents.eu.org/index.php/NO_Software_Patents">http://noepatents.eu.org</a>.</li>
