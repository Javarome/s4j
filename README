--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stellarium for Java (S4J) is the Java version of Stellarium, a free GPL software 
which renders realistic skies in real time with openGL. It is available on Java 
1.5 platforms and higher. With S4J, you really see what you can see with your 
eyes, binoculars or a small telescope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J2SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 or higher.
Java 3D 1.3 or higher.
JOGL
A 3d openGL acceleration card and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object and
middle mouse button or SPACE to center on the selected object.
Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
Press the H key for more help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From version 0.6.0 the most useful configuration options can be set from within
the program.
You can however change it by hand in the file located in config/config.ini on
Windows/MacOSX and in $HOME/.stellarium/ on a unix system.

		the	paper [1], with more accurate values from [2]. The blue shift
		formula is taken from [3] and combined with the Scotopic vision
		formula from [4].
