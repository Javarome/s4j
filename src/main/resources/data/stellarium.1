.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the

.PP
\fBstellarium\fP is a free GPL software which renders realistic skies in real time with openGL. It is available for Linux/Unix, Windows and MacOSX. With Stellarium, you really see what you can see with your eyes, binoculars or a small telescope.
.SH CONFIGURATION
When you first launch stellarium, it will use the file default_config.ini from /usr/share/stellarium/config/ to create  config.ini into \fB$HOME/.stellarium\fP.
The configuration options from this file are quite self-explanatory. Some configuration files examples are in /usr/share/doc/stellarium/examples.
