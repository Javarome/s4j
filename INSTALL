------ STELLARIUM FOR JAVA (S4J) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ------

WINDOWS OR MACOSX USERS : ----------------------------------
~$ java -jar target/

COMPILATION ----------------
To compile S4J using Maven, you will need Maven 2 installed.

You need to compile the sources :
change directory to the root directory of S4J where build.xml is located
~$ mvn compile

If the test are failing on your side, you can disable them by through the maven.test.skip system variable. For instance:

mvn assembly:assembly -Dmaven.test.skip=true

which will typically generate an executable JAR file into the "target" subdirectory:

then to launch the local version of the program type
~$ java -Djava.library.path=lib/mac -jar target/s4j-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

to fully install S4J (so that it will be launchable from everywhere) type
~$ mvn install
